# [Note Taker](https://github.com/domdecap/note-taker)



## Description

This is a note taker application. The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize myself with Express and further my abilities with Node. This application mainly works by utilizing GET and POST paths.

## Technologies

I used JavaScript, Express, Node, npm, and Render.

## Install

Prerequisites: [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en) ```v20.12.2```

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Open in code editior (I used VS Code).
3. Open a new instance of the integrated terminal.
4. Run ```npm i``` to install dependencies.

## Usage

After following installation instructions, run ```node server.js``` in the integrated terminal to launch SVG logo maker questions. From there, you should see a line in the terminal that says ```App listening at http://localhost:3001```. Click on the local host link to be brought to the application. Once in the application, you can add new tasks and delete completed tasks.

## Demo



## Contributions

I utilized the mini project from Module 11 to get the basic structure of the files. I also used the AskBCS assistant to get paired with a tutor who helped me.
